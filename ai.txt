I used AI to understand how Jinja2 macros work (for results.html).
I noticed that I had a ton of repetitive code while I was writing my itinerary display code, and I realized
that there is definitely a better method out there to simplify repetitive html codes.

Here is the prompt I asked AI: "If I have a lot of repetitive html code, can I make a template or something within
the program to make it more concise? How? I am using Flask."

The AI gave me a few different options for Jinja2 Templates, and listed things like base templates, reusable components,
Jinja loops, and Macros. It described Macros as reusable functions, which seemed the most applicable for my situation.
I used AI to break explain how Macros work to pass in different data. I then used that knowledge to apply to my project.

I also used AI to ask how to customize html webpages without bootstrap, and it told me to make my own css file.
I took that recommendation and looked at youtube videos and google to learn how to use basic css. I also asked AI how
to change the default input box field formatting (and the user-input font), since that was something I was stuck on.
